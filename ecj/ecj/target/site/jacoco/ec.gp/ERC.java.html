/**
 * ERC is an abstract GPNode which implements Ephemeral Random Constants,
 * as described in Koza I.  An ERC is a node which, when first instantiated,
 * gets set to some random constant value which it always returns from
 * then on, even after being crossed over into other individuals.
 * In order to implement an ERC, you need to override several methods below.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;Impementing an ERC&lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * A basic no-frills ERC needs to have the following things:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The data holding the ERC (perhaps a float or a couple of floats)
 * &lt;li&gt;An implementation of the &lt;b&gt;eval&lt;/b&gt; method which returns the appropriate
 *     data when the node is evaluated.
 * &lt;li&gt;Possibly an implementation of the &lt;b&gt;clone&lt;/b&gt; method to copy that data
 *     properly.  If your ERC data is just a simple or immutable type
 *     (like an int or a string), you don't need write a clone() method;
 *     the default one works fine.  But if your data is an array or other
 *     mutable object, you'll need to override the clone() method to copy
 *     the array.  
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;An implementation of the &lt;b&gt;resetNode&lt;/b&gt; method to randomize the
 *     data once cloned from the prototype.  This essentially &quot;initializes&quot;
 *     your ERC.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;An implementation of the &lt;b&gt;encode&lt;/b&gt; method which presents the
 *     ERC as a String.  If you don't plan on writing individuals out to
 *     files in a fashion that enables them to be read back in again later,
 *     but only care to print out individuals for statistics purposes, 
 *     you can implement this to just
 *     write &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&quot; + &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt; is your data.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;An implementation of the &lt;b&gt;nodeEquals&lt;/b&gt; method to return true if
 *     the other node is also an ERC of the same type, and it has the
 *     same ERC data as yourself.
 *
 *
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * 
 * A more advanced ERC will need some of the following gizmos:
 * 
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;If you have ERCs of different class types (for example, a vector ERC
 *      and a floating-point scalar ERC), you will wish to distinguish them
 *      when they're printed to files.  To do this,  override the &lt;b&gt;name&lt;/b&gt; 
 *      method to return different strings for each of them (perhaps &quot;vec&quot; versus &quot;&quot;).
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;If you want to write your ERCs to files such that they can be read
 *      back in again, you'll need to override the &lt;b&gt;encode&lt;/b&gt; method
 *      to write using the &lt;tt&gt;ec.util.Code&lt;/tt&gt; class.  Further, you'll need to
 *      override the &lt;b&gt;decode&lt;/b&gt; method to read in the individual using the
 *      &lt;tt&gt;ec.util.Code&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ec.util.DecodeReturn&lt;/tt&gt; classes.  The
 *      default version -- which is wrong -- returns &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *      When you do this, you'll probably also want to override the &lt;b&gt;toStringForHumans()&lt;/b&gt;
 *      method to return a simple string form of the ERC: perhaps just a number
 *      or a vector like &quot;&lt;7.24, 9.23&gt;&quot;.  This is because by default &lt;b&gt;toStringForHumans()&lt;/b&gt;
 *      calls &lt;b&gt;toString()&lt;/b&gt;, which in turn calls &lt;b&gt;encode&lt;/b&gt;, which you have
 *      just overidden to be more computer-ish.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;ERCs can be mutated using a custom mutator pipeline, for example the
 *     &lt;b&gt;ec.gp.breed.MutateERCPipeline&lt;/b&gt;.  If you expect to mutate your ERCs,
 *     you may wish to override the &lt;b&gt;mutateERC&lt;/b&gt; method to do something
 *     more subtle than its default setting (which just randomizes the
 *     ERC again, by calling resetNode).
 * 
 * &lt;li&gt;The default &lt;b&gt;nodeHashCode&lt;/b&gt; implementation is poor and slow (it
 *     creates a string using encode() and then hashes the sting).  You might
 *     create a better (and probably simpler) hash code function.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;If you're going to use facilities such as the Island Model or the distributed
 *     evaluator, you'll need to implement the &lt;b&gt;writeNode&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;readNode&lt;/b&gt;
 *     methods to read/write the node to DataInput/DataOutput.  The default implementations
 *     just throw errors.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;If you need to set up your ERC class from the parameter file, do so in the &lt;b&gt;setup&lt;/b&gt; method.
 *
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; See the &lt;b&gt;ec.app.regression.func.RegERC&lt;/b&gt; class for an example of a simple but &quot;fuly-implemented&quot;
 * ERC.  A slightly more complicated example can be found in &lt;b&gt;ec.app.lawnmower.func.LawnERC&lt;/b&gt;.
