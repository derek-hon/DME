/**
 * Rule is an abstract class for describing rules. It is abstract
 * because it is supposed to be extended by different classes
 * modelling different kinds of rules.
 * It provides the reset abstract method for randomizing the individual. 
 * It also provides the mutate function for mutating an individual rule
 * It also provides the clone function for cloning the rule.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;You will need to implement some kind of artificial ordering between
 * rules in a ruleset using the Comparable interface,
 * so the ruleset can be sorted in such a way that it can be compared with
 * another ruleset for equality.  You should also implement hashCode
 * and equals 
 * in such a way that they aren't based on pointer information, but on actual
 * internal features. 
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Every rule points to a RuleConstraints which handles information that
 * Rule shares with all the other Rules in a RuleSet.

 * &lt;p&gt;In addition to serialization for checkpointing, Rules may read and write themselves to streams in three ways.
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;writeRule(...,DataOutput)/readRule(...,DataInput)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This method
 * transmits or receives a Rule in binary.  It is the most efficient approach to sending
 * Rules over networks, etc.  The default versions of writeRule/readRule throw errors.
 * You don't need to implement them if you don't plan on using read/writeRule.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;printRule(...,PrintWriter)/readRule(...,LineNumberReader)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This
 * approach transmits or receives a Rule in text encoded such that the Rule is largely readable
 * by humans but can be read back in 100% by ECJ as well.  To do this, these methods will typically encode numbers
 * using the &lt;tt&gt;ec.util.Code&lt;/tt&gt; class.  These methods are mostly used to write out populations to
 * files for inspection, slight modification, then reading back in later on.  &lt;b&gt;readRule&lt;/b&gt;
 * reads in a line, then calls &lt;b&gt;readRuleFromString&lt;/b&gt; on that line.
 * You are responsible for implementing readRuleFromString: the Code class is there to help you.
 * The default version throws an error if called.
 * &lt;b&gt;printRule&lt;/b&gt; calls &lt;b&gt;printRuleToString&lt;b&gt;
 * and printlns the resultant string. You are responsible for implementing the printRuleToString method in such
 * a way that readRuleFromString can read back in the Rule println'd with printRuleToString.  The default form
 * of printRuleToString() simply calls &lt;b&gt;toString()&lt;/b&gt; 
 * by default.  You might override &lt;b&gt;printRuleToString()&lt;/b&gt; to provide better information.   You are not required to implement these methods, but without
 * them you will not be able to write Rules to files in a simultaneously computer- and human-readable fashion.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;printRuleForHumans(...,PrintWriter)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This
 * approach prints a Rule in a fashion intended for human consumption only.
 * &lt;b&gt;printRuleForHumans&lt;/b&gt; calls &lt;b&gt;printRuleToStringForHumans()&lt;b&gt; 
 * and printlns the resultant string.  The default form of this method just returns the value of
 * &lt;b&gt;toString()&lt;/b&gt;. You may wish to override this to provide more information instead. 
 * You should handle one of these methods properly
 * to ensure Rules can be printed by ECJ.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parameters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
