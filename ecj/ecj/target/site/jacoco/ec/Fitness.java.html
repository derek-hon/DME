/**
 * Fitness is a prototype which describes the fitness of an individual.
 * Every individual contains exactly one Fitness object.
 * Fitness objects are compared to each other with the equivalentTo()
 * and betterThan(), etc. methods. 
 *
 &lt;p&gt;Rules: 
 &lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;comparison&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;method&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;a &amp;gt; b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;a.betterThan(b)&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;a &amp;gt;= b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;a.betterThan(b) || a.equivalentTo(b)&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;a = b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;a.equivalentTo(b)&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;

 This applies even to multiobjective pareto-style dominance, eg:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; a dominates b :: a &amp;gt; b
 &lt;li&gt; a and b do not dominate each other :: a = b
 &lt;li&gt; b dominates a :: a &amp;lt; b
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parameter bases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;table&gt;

 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;&lt;tt&gt;fit&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;default fitness base&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;

        value, it should use the equivalentTo() and betterThan() methods instead.
