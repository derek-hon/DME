/**
 * A Breeder is a singleton object which is responsible for the breeding
 * process during the course of an evolutionary run.  Only one Breeder
 * is created in a run, and is stored in the EvolutionState object.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Breeders typically do their work by applying a Species' BreedingPipelines
 * on subpopulations of that species to produce new individuals for those
 * subpopulations.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Breeders may be multithreaded.  The number of threads they may spawn
 * (excepting a parent &quot;gathering&quot; thread) is governed by the EvolutionState's
 * breedthreads value.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Be careful about spawning threads -- this system has no few synchronized 
 * methods for efficiency's sake, so you must either divvy up breeding in a
 * thread-safe fashion and assume that all individuals
 * in the current population are read-only (which you may assume for a generational
 * breeder which needs to return a whole new population each generation), or
 * otherwise you must obtain the appropriate locks on individuals in the population
 * and other objects as necessary.
