 * Created: Tue Aug 10 19:58:13 1999

/**
 * An Individual is an item in the EC population stew which is evaluated 
 * and assigned a fitness which determines its likelihood of selection.
 * Individuals are created most commonly by the newIndividual(...) method
 * of the ec.Species class.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;In general Individuals are immutable.  That is, once they are created
 * their genetic material should not be modified.  This protocol helps insure that they are
 * safe to read under multithreaded conditions.  You can violate this protocol,
 * but try to do so when you know you have only have a single thread.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In addition to serialization for checkpointing, Individuals may read and write themselves to streams in three ways.
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;writeIndividual(...,DataOutput)/readIndividual(...,DataInput)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This method
 * transmits or receives an individual in binary.  It is the most efficient approach to sending
 * individuals over networks, etc.  These methods write the evaluated flag and the fitness, then
 * call &lt;b&gt;readGenotype/writeGenotype&lt;/b&gt;, which you must implement to write those parts of your 
 * Individual special to your functions-- the default versions of readGenotype/writeGenotype throw errors.
 * You don't need to implement them if you don't plan on using read/writeIndividual.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;printIndividual(...,PrintWriter)/readIndividual(...,LineNumberReader)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This
 * approach transmits or receives an indivdual in text encoded such that the individual is largely readable
 * by humans but can be read back in 100% by ECJ as well.  To do this, these methods will encode numbers
 * using the &lt;tt&gt;ec.util.Code&lt;/tt&gt; class.  These methods are mostly used to write out populations to
 * files for inspection, slight modification, then reading back in later on.  &lt;b&gt;readIndividual&lt;/b&gt;reads
 * in the fitness and the evaluation flag, then calls &lt;b&gt;parseGenotype&lt;/b&gt; to read in the remaining individual.
 * You are responsible for implementing parseGenotype: the Code class is there to help you.
 * &lt;b&gt;printIndividual&lt;/b&gt; writes out the fitness and evaluation flag, then calls &lt;b&gt;genotypeToString&lt;/b&gt; 
 * and printlns the resultant string. You are responsible for implementing the genotypeToString method in such
 * a way that parseGenotype can read back in the individual println'd with genotypeToString.  The default form
 * of genotypeToString simply calls &lt;b&gt;toString&lt;/b&gt;, which you may override instead if you like.  The default
 * form of &lt;b&gt;parseGenotype&lt;/b&gt; throws an error.  You are not required to implement these methods, but without
 * them you will not be able to write individuals to files in a simultaneously computer- and human-readable fashion.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;printIndividualForHumans(...,PrintWriter)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This
 * approach prints an individual in a fashion intended for human consumption only.
 * &lt;b&gt;printIndividualForHumans&lt;/b&gt; writes out the fitness and evaluation flag, then calls &lt;b&gt;genotypeToStringForHumans&lt;b&gt; 
 * and printlns the resultant string. You are responsible for implementing the genotypeToStringForHumans method.
 * The default form of genotypeToStringForHumans simply calls &lt;b&gt;toString&lt;/b&gt;, which you may override instead if you like
 * (though note that genotypeToString's default also calls toString).  You should handle one of these methods properly
 * to ensure individuals can be printed by ECJ.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Since individuals should be largely immutable, why is there a &lt;b&gt;readIndividual&lt;/b&gt; method?
 * after all this method doesn't create a &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; individual -- it just erases the existing one.  This is
 * largely historical; but the method is used underneath by the various &lt;b&gt;newIndividual&lt;/b&gt; methods in Species,
 * which &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; create new individuals read from files.  If you're trying to create a brand new individual
 * read from a file, look in Species.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Individuals are Comparable: if you sort Individuals, the FITTER individuals will appear EARLIER in a list or array.
