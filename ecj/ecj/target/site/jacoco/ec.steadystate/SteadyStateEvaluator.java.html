/**
 * This subclass of Evaluator performs the evaluation portion of Steady-State Evolution and (in distributed form)
 * Asynchronous Evolution. The procedure is as follows.  We begin with an empty Population and one by
 * one create new Indivdiuals and send them off to be evaluated.  In basic Steady-State Evolution the
 * individuals are immediately evaluated and we wait for them; but in Asynchronous Evolution the individuals are evaluated
 * for however long it takes and we don't wait for them to finish.  When individuals return they are
 * added to the Population until it is full.  No duplicate individuals are allowed.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;At this point the system switches to its &quot;steady state&quot;: individuals are bred from the population
 * one by one, and sent off to be evaluated.  Once again, in basic Steady-State Evolution the
 * individuals are immediately evaluated and we wait for them; but in Asynchronous Evolution the individuals are evaluated
 * for however long it takes and we don't wait for them to finish.  When an individual returns, we
 * mark an individual in the Population for death, then replace it with the new returning individual.
 * Note that during the steady-state, Asynchronous Evolution could be still sending back some &quot;new&quot; individuals
 * created during the initialization phase, not &quot;bred&quot; individuals.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The determination of how an individual is marked for death is done by the SteadyStateBreeder.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;When SteadyStateEvaluator sends indivduals off to be evaluated, it stores them in an internal queue, along
 * with the subpopulation in which they were destined.  This tuple is defined by QueueIndividual.java
