/**
 * ThreadPool.java
 * 
 * A simple, lightweight thread pool, for those who cannot or will not use Java's baroque
 * java.util.concurrent package.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;A ThreadPool manages a set of &quot;Workers&quot;, each of which manages a java.lang.Thread
 * ready to be used to run a task for you.  The threads are setDaemon(true), so they'll
 * automatically die when the program is terminated.   At any point
 * in time, a Worker is either *pooled*, meaning it is in the ThreadPool and available to be
 * used, or it is *outstanding*, meaning that it is presently working on a Runnable that has
 * been assigned it. 
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;You obtain a Worker from a ThreadPool by calling start(...), passing in a Runnable
 * which is the code you wish the Worker to perform.  When this Runnable is completed,
 * that is, when its run() method exits, the Worker will automatically rejoin the ThreadPool
 * and become available for use in future.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A Worker manages a Thread underneath in which the Runnable is run. The Worker has a
 * method called interrupt() which you can call if you wish to have interrupt() called on
 * the underlying Thread; otherwise you shouldn't really play around with the underlying
 * thread even if you can obtain it (via Thread.currentThread() for example).  
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;If there are no Workers presently available in the pool when you request one, a new Worker, and
 * an associated underlying thread, will be created on the fly.  When this Worker is done,
 * it will enter the Pool with the others.  Thus the total number of Workers will never shrink,
 * though it may stay the same size.  If you want to trim the number of Workers presently in
 * the Pool, you can call killPooled(), though it's not a common need.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;You might wish to control the total number of workers at any particular time.  You
 * can do this by using a version of start() which takes a maximum number of workers.  This
 * version will block as long as the number of current working threads is greater than
 * or equal to the desired maximum, then start() afterwards. 
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;You can wait for an outstanding Worker to finish its task by calling join(...).  You can wait for
 * all outstanding Workers to finish their tasks by calling joinAll(...).  This is useful
 * for spawning a number of Workers, then waiting for them to all finish.  And you can
 * wait for all outstanding Workers to finish their tasks, followed by killing them and all
 * their underlying threads (perhaps to clean up in preparation for quitting your program)
 * by calling killAll(...).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;ThreadPool is java.io.Serializable: but if it is serialized out, it won't serialize
 * out its worker threads, so when it is deserialized back in, the threads will be
 * gone.
